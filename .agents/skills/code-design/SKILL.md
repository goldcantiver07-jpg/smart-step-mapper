# Code Design

Use this skill as a **Code Design Auditor** — enforcing function-level design principles that make code predictable, readable, and maintainable. This skill pairs with `folder-architecture` (file/directory structure) and `audit-codebase` (structural health) to cover the **code quality** dimension those skills don't address.

## Core Principles

### 1. Pure Functions — Predictable by Contract

A pure function:

- Returns the **same output** for the **same input** (referential transparency)
- Has **no side effects** (no mutation of external state, no I/O, no DB, no network)

**Benefit:** Testable without mocks, safe to parallelize, trivial to reason about.

```python
# IMPURE: depends on external state, mutates global
discount_rate = 0.1
def apply_discount(price):
    global discount_rate
    return price * discount_rate

# PURE: output depends only on input, no mutation
def apply_discount(price: float, rate: float) -> float:
    return price * rate
```

**When to violate:** I/O, DB, network, logging — these are inherently impure. The rule is: **push side effects to the edges** (the "imperative shell"), keep the core logic pure.

### 2. Function-Level Single Responsibility

> "A function should have one reason to change." — Robert C. Martin

**Test:** Can you describe what the function does in one sentence without using "and" or "then"? (See the ["And" Test in the reference](references/REFERENCE.md#single-responsibility--the-and-test) for more.)

```python
# BAD: Three responsibilities in one function
def process_order(order):
    # Responsibility 1: Validation
    if not order.get("items"):
        raise ValueError("No items")
    if not order.get("customer"):
        raise ValueError("No customer")

    # Responsibility 2: Business logic
    total = sum(item["price"] * item["qty"] for item in order["items"])
    discount = total * 0.1 if total > 100 else 0
    final = total - discount

    # Responsibility 3: Persistence
    db.save(order)
    email.send(order["customer"], "Order confirmed")

    return final

# GOOD: Each function has one responsibility
def validate_order(order: dict) -> None:
    if not order.get("items"):
        raise ValueError("No items")
    if not order.get("customer"):
        raise ValueError("No customer")

def calculate_total(order: dict) -> float:
    subtotal = sum(item["price"] * item["qty"] for item in order["items"])
    discount = subtotal * 0.1 if subtotal > 100 else 0
    return subtotal - discount

def process_order(order: dict) -> float:
    """Orchestration — coordinates the pure logic, defers side effects."""
    validate_order(order)
    total = calculate_total(order)
    return total

# Side effects handled at the caller level (the imperative shell)
```

### 3. Top-to-Bottom Readability — Linear Control Flow

Code should read like a checklist, not a maze. The happy path should be at the bottom, not buried inside nested braces.

#### Guard Clauses (Fail Fast)

Handle edge cases immediately, then proceed with the happy path unindented:

```python
# BAD: Nested pyramid — happy path buried inside 3 levels of if
def process_user(user):
    if user:
        if user.is_active:
            if user.email:
                return send_email(user.email)
            else:
                return "No email"
        else:
            return "Inactive"
    else:
        return "No user"

# GOOD: Guard clauses — flat, linear, happy path at the bottom
def process_user(user):
    if not user:
        return "No user"
    if not user.is_active:
        return "Inactive"
    if not user.email:
        return "No email"

    return send_email(user.email)  # Happy path — unindented, obvious
```

**Guard clause rules:**

- Check the **invalid/failure case** first (negate the condition)
- Each guard is at the **same indentation level**
- The **happy path runs last**, at the bottom, also at base indent
- Adding a new validation means adding **one more guard** — not restructuring existing code

#### Early Return Pattern

```typescript
// BAD: else-branch nesting
function getUserDisplayName(user: User | null | undefined): string {
  if (user) {
    if (user.firstName) {
      return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName ?? ""}`.trim();
    } else {
      return user.email;
    }
  } else {
    return "Anonymous";
  }
}

// GOOD: Early returns — flat, each case handled once
function getUserDisplayName(user: User | null | undefined): string {
  if (!user) return "Anonymous";
  if (!user.firstName) return user.email;
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName ?? ""}`.trim();
}
```

### 4. Side Effect Management — The Imperative Shell Pattern

Structure every system as:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Imperative Shell (side effects)    │
│  - Parse input, call pure logic,    │
│    perform I/O, handle results      │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Pure Core (no side effects)  │  │
│  │  - Business logic             │  │
│  │  - Calculations               │  │
│  │  - Transformations            │  │
│  │  - Validation                 │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```python
# BAD: Side effects mixed with logic
def create_user(db, email, name):
    if not email or "@" not in email:
        return {"error": "Invalid email"}  # mixed concern
    user = db.users.insert_one({"email": email, "name": name})  # IO
    send_welcome_email(email)  # side effect
    return {"id": str(user.inserted_id)}

# GOOD: Pure logic separated from side effects
def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    return bool(email and "@" in email)

def build_user_doc(email: str, name: str) -> dict:
    return {"email": email, "name": name}

# In the imperative shell (handler/controller):
def create_user_handler(db, email, name):
    if not validate_email(email):
        return {"error": "Invalid email"}
    doc = build_user_doc(email, name)
    result = db.users.insert_one(doc)  # side effect at edge
    send_welcome_email(email)          # side effect at edge
    return {"id": str(result.inserted_id)}
```

### 5. Reduce Cognitive Load — Naming & Variable Management

| Principle                 | Bad                                      | Good                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope-length naming**   | short vars in wide scope                 | short vars in tight scope, descriptive in wide                                                    |
| **Explaining variables**  | `if a > 18 and a < 65 and s == "active"` | `is_working_age = 18 < age < 65; is_active = status == "active"; if is_working_age and is_active` |
| **Write-once variables**  | Reassign same variable 3 times           | Use separate named variables per value                                                            |
| **No magic numbers**      | `if total * 0.1 > 50`                    | `DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD = 500; if total * DISCOUNT_RATE > DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD`                         |
| **Positive conditionals** | `if not user.is_disabled() and not ...`  | `if user.is_enabled() and ...`                                                                    |

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep nesting (3+ levels)** | Count indentation depth                        | Guard clauses, early returns, extract helper |
| **Mixed responsibilities**   | Function has "and" in its description          | Split into one function per responsibility   |
| **External state read**      | Function reads global/module-level mutable var | Pass as parameter                            |
| **External state write**     | Function modifies param, global, or static     | Return new value instead                     |
| **I/O mixed with logic**     | DB/network/file inside calculation             | Imperative shell pattern                     |
| **Long parameter list (4+)** | Count params at call site                      | Bundle into object/dataclass                 |
| **Magic values**             | Bare numbers/strings in logic                  | Named constants                              |
| **Side effect in name**      | `process_and_save`, `validate_and_notify`      | Split into separate functions                |

## Workflow: Code Design Review Checklist

Before writing every function (or during code review), run through this checklist:

### Step 1: Check Purity

- [ ] Does the function read or write any external state (file, DB, global, network)?
- [ ] If yes — can the side effect be pushed to the caller?
- [ ] If it must stay, is the impure part isolated from the pure logic?

### Step 2: Check Responsibility

- [ ] Can you describe the function in one sentence without "and"?
- [ ] Does the function have distinct sections separated by comments? (That's a split signal)
- [ ] Count the "levels" of abstraction — is it mixing low-level (DB queries) with high-level (business rules)?

### Step 3: Check Control Flow

- [ ] Maximum indentation depth in the function (target: ≤2 levels)
- [ ] Are there guard clauses for all precondition failures?
- [ ] Is the happy path immediately visible (not buried in else)?
- [ ] Can you trace execution from top to bottom without jumping?

### Step 4: Check Side Effects

- [ ] Does the function mutate its input parameters?
- [ ] Does the function modify any variable outside its scope?
- [ ] Does it perform I/O (console, file, network, DB)?
- [ ] Are side effects grouped at the edges (start/end) of the function?

### Step 5: Check Names & Variables

- [ ] Are there magic numbers or strings without named constants?
- [ ] Are any variables reassigned multiple times?
- [ ] Do variable names describe WHAT, not HOW?
- [ ] Is every variable used within a reasonable scope (not 50 lines from declaration)?

## Red Flags — STOP and Refactor

These patterns mean the function needs design work before continuing:

```
"Let me just add one more if statement inside this if block"
    → You're creating nesting. Extract a guard clause.

"I'll handle the edge case in the else branch"
    → Use early return instead.

"I'll just add a parameter for this one extra thing"
    → Your function is accumulating responsibilities.

"I'll write a quick test after the implementation"
    → If it's hard to test, your design is wrong. Fix design first.

"This function is long but it's all related"
    → "Related" != "same responsibility". Find the split points.

"I'll call this function and then do a database save"
    → The function should return data, you save it at the caller.

"It's just one global variable"
    → One global today, five globals next month. Pass it as a parameter.
```

## When This Skill Activates

Activate this skill whenever:

- Writing or reviewing a function that is:
  - > 30 lines long
  - > 2 levels of indentation deep
  - Hard to name (vague verb like `process`, `handle`, `doStuff`)
  - Hard to test (requires mocks for simple logic)
- Refactoring existing code with nesting or mixed concerns
- During code review of any new function
- Before committing code that changes business logic
- When `folder-architecture` warns about an oversized file — this skill decides HOW to split the functions inside

## Interaction with Other Skills

| Skill                             | This skill adds                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **folder-architecture**           | Handles **file-level** checks (where files go); this handles **function-level** checks (how code is written inside files) |
| **audit-codebase**                | Scans for oversized files (>400 lines); this skill tells you HOW to split the code at function boundaries                 |
| **implement-folder-architecture** | Moves files around; this skill ensures the MOVED code is well-designed before the move                                    |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake              | Why it happens                              | Fix                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-splitting       | "Every function must be tiny!"              | Group closely related steps, use 5-15 line functions as guideline, not law |
| Extreme purity       | "No side effects ever!"                     | Push I/O to edges, don't eliminate it — programs need to do things         |
| Guard clause overuse | 12 guards before the happy path             | The function is doing too much. Split into sub-functions                   |
| Named everything     | `user_age = age; is_adult = user_age >= 18` | Names should add INFORMATION, not rename things                            |

## Language-Specific Notes

While the principles are language-agnostic, here are common traps per language:

| Language          | Common Violation                        | Fix                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**        | Mutable default args (`def f(x=[])`)    | Use `None` + default factory                         |
| **JavaScript/TS** | Mutating objects passed by reference    | Spread/immutable update patterns                     |
| **Go**            | Pointer receivers that mutate           | Prefer value receivers or return new struct          |
| **Rust**          | Unnecessary `mut`                       | Ownership model already forces purity — lean into it |
| **Java**          | God service classes with injected repos | Split by domain, keep methods focused                |
| **C#**            | `ref`/`out` parameters overused         | Return a result object instead                       |
| **Ruby**          | Monkey-patching + side effects          | Prefer composition over modification                 |

## Verification

After applying code design changes:

- [ ] Every function has a clear single purpose
- [ ] Maximum nesting depth is ≤2 levels
- [ ] Side effects are at the edges (not mixed with logic)
- [ ] Pure functions are testable without mocks
- [ ] The happy path reads top-to-bottom without mental stack-jumping
- [ ] No magic numbers or unexplained values
- [ ] Parameters are stable (3 or fewer, or bundled in a config object)
